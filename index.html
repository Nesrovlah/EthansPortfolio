                    <p>From July 12 2024 to the 21st, Myself and my team created a first person for Godot Wild Jam 71 called "The Only Weapon is You". I worked on the state based enemy ai as well as several other mechanics. The program runs on browsers and can be dowloaded to run on windows.<br><br><a href ="https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-71/rate/2847584">https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-71/rate/2847584</a></href><br><a href ="https://aidroh.itch.io/the-only-weapon-is-you">https://aidroh.itch.io/the-only-weapon-is-you</a></p>

                    <p>From september 2023 to april 2024, I was part of an eight person team where we had to create a website for a client. I cant say much about the website but it gave out online tests. I worked on the home page and the results page for the tests. This website used Vue JS</p>

                    <h3>DSVR</h3>
                    <p>Over the summer of 2023 I created demo for a vitual reality horror game based on the game Dead Space Mobile in Unity. I coded everything myself and created all the assets. I had not taken a course in Unity or C# yet and taught it to myself over the summer. The entire player interface works. All that needs to be done is to create the other levels and the enemies. I will surely work on this more.</p>
